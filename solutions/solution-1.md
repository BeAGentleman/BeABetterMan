# Solution 1: Clarifying Intentions

## Description
To resolve the misunderstanding, John takes the following steps:

1. **Acknowledgment:** John acknowledges Jane's feelings without getting defensive.
   - "I see that my message upset you, and I'm sorry for that."
2. **Clarification:** John explains his state of mind when he sent the message.
   - "I was feeling really stressed from work and didn't mean to come across as dismissive."
3. **Reassurance:** John reassures Jane of his feelings.
   - "I value our conversations and your feelings are important to me."
4. **Check-In:** John asks Jane how she would prefer to communicate when one of them is busy or stressed.
   - "How can we make sure this doesn't happen again? What can I do differently next time?"
